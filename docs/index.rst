This library provides a workflow for harmonising non-pharmaceutical \
intervention data from seven existing providers. Currently implements cleaning of \
datasets from `JH_HIT <https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/hit-covid>`_,  \
`CDC_ITF <https://www.cdc.gov/>`_, \
`OXCGRT <https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker>`_,  \
and `ACAPS <https://www.acaps.org/covid-19-government-measures-dataset>`_.

The **WHO PHSM** project is a collaboration between data providers, \
the `World Health Organisation <https://www.who.int/>`_, and \
the `London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine <https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/>`_.
