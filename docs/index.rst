WHO PHSM Cleaning's documentation
=============================================

The WHO PHSM project unifies datasets on non-pharmaceutical interventions around the world.

Data is then cleaned by over 200 volunteers and released weekly.

This repository contains the code used to harmonise provider datasets.

See a problem with the cleaning routine? Please `open an issue<https://github.com/lshtm-gis/WHO_PHSM_Cleaning/issues/new>`.
